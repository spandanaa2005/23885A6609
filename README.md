REACT URL SHORTENER
A simple and stylish frontend-only React app to shorten long URLs. It generates fake short URLs like https://sho.rt/abc123 and provides copy-to-clipboard functionality with user feedback.

Features: 
1. Converts long URLs into short-looking ones
2. Copy-to-clipboard support
3. Instant feedback when copied
4. Clean and modern responsive design
5.  Built using React and plain CSS
6. Generates unique codes for each URL

Tech Stack:
1. React (via Create React App)
2. JavaScript (ES6)
3. Lucide React (icons)
4. CSS (no frameworks)

How It Works:
The app takes a long URL as input. It generates a fake short link using random strings (or hashing). You can copy the short link using the ðŸ“‹ icon. "Copied!" message is shown temporarily.
Note :This is a frontend-only project â€” the short URLs are not real and are not stored in a database.
